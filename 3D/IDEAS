from Nico:

Transparent console log, accessible by TAB key
Card hand moves too quickly, scale by mouse acceleration
Too easy to accidentally play a zero cost card, make playing require a double click
Add turn stops

Long term - 

Integrate the way abilities are resolved so there is no duplication of code (see resolve.txt)
