Things that don't work:

Targeting is broken in one of two ways, based on what happens when the ability is copied for playing it:

12/10/07 - this has been fixed by adding an attribute, copy_targets to the Ability class. Non permanent spells (like sorceries and instants) don't need to copy their targets (since they can only be played once per instance of the card) so they don't copy their targets. Everything else does by default. (although Duct Crawler is still broken, since the target is required for its activated ability)

* When I make a copy of the target, any abilities that use closures on the original target ('grep "^target" -l *' to find the cards) won't work, since they refer to the original target. So these cards won't work:
	Cone of Flame
	Cryoclasm
	Duct Crawler
	Hurkyl's Recall
	Reminisce	

* If I don't make a copy, then abilities that can be placed multiple times on the stack will all use the same target (since they all point to the same target object).


There's a bug with lifelink and trample, where the lifelink gain is too much

Attach Loxodon Scimitar to creature. Destroy Creature. Attach to another Creature. When resolving:
  File "/Users/Naveen/Projects/Incantus/src/game/GameObjects.py", line 14, in send
    dispatcher.send(event, self, *args, **named)
  File "/Users/Naveen/Projects/Incantus/src/game/pydispatch/dispatcher.py", line 356, in send
    sender=sender,
  File "/Users/Naveen/Projects/Incantus/src/game/pydispatch/robustapply.py", line 47, in robustApply
    return receiver(*arguments, **named)
  File "/Users/Naveen/Projects/Incantus/src/game/Ability/Trigger.py", line 40, in <lambda>
    unregister = lambda: self.unregister(self.filter, event=self.trigger_event, sender=self.trigger_sender)
  File "/Users/Naveen/Projects/Incantus/src/game/GameObjects.py", line 26, in unregister
    dispatcher.disconnect(callback, signal=event, sender=sender, weak=weak)
  File "/Users/Naveen/Projects/Incantus/src/game/pydispatch/dispatcher.py", line 225, in disconnect
    raise errors.DispatcherKeyError(
game.pydispatch.errors.DispatcherKeyError: 'No receivers found for signal <game.GameEvent.DealsDamageEvent object at 0x887e510> from sender Llanowar Elves at 114780112'

The stack should be a true zone, where cards go, since the way I have it now, cards are still in hand (but that would be wrong for things like Hellbent)
